Along with many other features, it provides an extension mechanism. Seed7 supports introducing new syntax elements and their semantics into the language, and allows new language constructs to be defined and written in Seed7. For example, programmers can introduce syntax and semantics of new statements and user defined operator symbols. The implementation of Seed7 differs significantly from that of languages with hard-coded syntax and semantics.",

It uses two operands: a memory address where a data of one bit is stored, and program address. Although a unique instruction is used, the language formed by this instruction is demonstrably a bounded-storage machine (failing to be Turing complete only because it cannot reference memory that does not appear as an operand of a source instruction). The TOGA is an esoteric or academic computer, as many instructions are needed to do even a simple operation. However, the TOGA has a very simple architecture and the number of transistors to make a TOGA is extremely low.

Reading empty buffer returns the empty character/string. (The language can not read external input, and is thus classified output-only.) There are no limits for the program sizes or the output it creates. The program runs endlessly unless terminated with the terminating instruction. By cycle it is meant the lines of the program, from top to bottom, executed once. There are 36 one-character registers, each set to empty string on every cycle.
